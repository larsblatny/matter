# Matter

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/larsblatny/matter/actions/workflows/cmake-single-platform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/larsblatny/matter/actions/workflows/cmake-single-platform.yml)

_Matter_ is an open-source C++ implementation of the Material Point Method (MPM) with elasto-viscoplastic rheologies, specifically designed to model the mechanics and flow of granular matter. However, its usage extends to simulate a variety of different _matter_ undergoing small and large deformations.    

Developed across different sides of the Swiss Alps, this software is designed to be lightweight, easy to install and use, with few dependencies, without significantly compromising speed and performance. Parallelized on shared memory with OpenMP, millions of material points/particles can be simulated on (powerful) desktop workstations.

## Features

* Both **2D** (plane strain) and **3D**


* Supports Update Stress Last **(USL)** and Modified Update Stress Last **(MUSL)** udated Lagrangian **symplectic** (explicit) MPM


* Particle <-> grid interplation with **quadratic** and **cubic B-splines** with various transfer schemes:
    *  Linearly weighted combination of **PIC** and **FLIP** (Stomakhin et al., 2013)
    *  **APIC** (Jiang et al., 2015)
    *  **AFLIP** (Fei et al., 2021)


* Adaptive background **grid extension/reduction** to particle domain


* **Finite strain elasticity**. The following (hyper)elastic models are currently available:
    * Neo-Hookean model
    * Hencky's elasticity model


* The following **(visco)plastic models** are currently available and compatible with Hencky's elasticity model:
    * Von Mises
    * Drucker-Prager
    * Modified Cam-Clay
    * Perzyna-Von Mises
    * Perzyna-Drucker-Prager
    * Perzyna-Modified Cam-Clay
    * mu(I)-Drucker-Prager
    * mu(I)-Modified Cam-Clay
    * Implementing other (visco)plastic models is easy due to the general framework of the code


* Supports **analytical objects** and **complex terrains**


* The supported **boundary conditions** are   
    * No-slip (in code called `STICKY`)
    * Separate slip (in code called `SEPARATE`)
    * Sticky slip (in code called `SLIP`, currently only available for plate objects)   


* The boundary conditions above can be supplied a **Coulomb friction parameter**, or what we call "material friction", where an internal friction parameter of a particular plastic model is used as the Coulomb friction for terrain-material interaction.

* **Parallelized** on shared memory with [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)

* Initial particle positions can be sampled using the **Poisson disk sampling** scheme by R. Bridson, ACM SIGGRAPH 2007, here based on the implementation by [Tommy Hinks](https://github.com/thinks/poisson-disk-sampling)

## Limitations

* Optimized for dense (not sparse) topologies. On sparse topologies, the simulations can be rather slow. This follows from the chosen grid data format, which may be replaced in the future. However, the current choice keeps the code simple and organized.

* Supports only single-materials, however, one can easily extend this to multi-material problems. E.g., one can create particle quantities for the relevant material parameters (see `data_structures.hpp`) which can then be used in the material models (see, e.g., `plasticity.cpp`)

## Get started

#### Installing dependencies

The only required dependencies are **[CMake](https://cmake.org/)**, **[OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)** and the C++ linear algebra template library **[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)**. The option `-DUSE_VDB=ON` also requires **[OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/)**, however, this can be turned off if only analytic objects are used.

On Mac, you can install OpenMP through Homebrew with
`brew install libomp`
and Eigen can be obtained through
`brew install eigen`.

#### Build and run the code

1. Set up your simulation parameters and initial state in `mpm.cpp`. The default `mpm.cpp` file in the master branch sets up a simple granular collapse and explains the main options. In the `examples` folder, other examples are presented (to use one of these examples, simply copy it into the `src` folder and rename it `mpm.cpp`). In `tools.hpp`, the user must specify the dimension of the simulation (default: 2D) and order of interpolation (default: quadratic).

2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build`

3. From the build directory (`cd build`), specify CMake options: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_VDB=ON ..`

4. Compile with `make -j <number of cores for compilation>` (NB: the number of threads for the _simulation_ is specified in `mpm.cpp`)

5. Run the executable: `./src/mpm`


#### Objects and terrains

Rigid objects and terrains (boundaries) are either   
* formulated analytically as level sets (signed distance functions)   
* or imported as `.vdb` level sets files using [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/)   

Analytical objects can be specified as a derived class from the general `ObjectGeneral` class. An example of this is `ObjectBump` which provides the terrain of a smooth bump used in the flow experiments in [Viroulet et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2017.41). For the very common case of an axis-aligned plate, an `ObjectPlate` class has been made separate from `ObjectGeneral` class for speed and convenience. In `ObjectPlate`, you can also assign a speed (and controls on the time-evolution of the speed) of the plate. Any plate must either a `top`, `bottom`, `front`, `back`, `left` or `right`. Its usage can be seen in the default example in `mpm.cpp` where it is used to simple set the ground (y = 0).

A terrain/object from a `.vdb` is stored in an instance of the `ObjectVdb` class which is also derived from `ObjectGeneral`.
Examples of `.vdb`-files are found in the folder `levelsets`. This includes `vdb`-files which defines level sets for particle sampling.

Note that all `ObjectGeneral` instances must be added to the std::vector `objects` and `ObjectPlate` instances are added to the std::vector `plates`.


#### Saving simulation data

The directory to save the output data is specified by the user in `mpm.cpp`.
Particle data is saved as **binary PLY-files** (using [tinyply](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/tinyply)) with the format (`particles_fX.ply`) where X represents the frame number (from 0 to `end_frame` as specified by the user).

We recommend [SideFX's Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com) for visualization the particle data. In the file `visualize.hipnc` in the `postprocess` directory, we show how to make a simple visualization of the data. Some simple post-processing can also be done directly in Houdini. PLY files can also be easily imported in Python for post-processing. This is shown in the file `load_ply.py` which can be found in the `postprocess` directory.

Optionally, the grid data can also be saved if `save_grid = true`. Then, the grid data is saved as `grid_fX.ply`. By default, the grid data is not saved.


#### Key parameters and options
This is a non-exhaustive list of parameters and options (of the `Simulation` class) to be specified in the input file `mpm.cpp`. See `simulation.hpp` for the complete list, and take advantage of the current `mpm.cpp` example file. Other example files are found in the `examples` directory.

In the MCC-based models, one must also choose a corresponding hardening law, either 1) an exponential explicit law `ExpExpl`, 2) a hyperbolic sine explicit law `SinhExpl` or 3) an exponential implicit law `ExpImpl`.


### Troubleshooting

* On Mac, if OpenMP was installed through Homebrew, you might need to use the following CMake options when building, depending on your version:   
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOpenMP_CXX_FLAG="-Xclang -fopenmp" -DOpenMP_CXX_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/include -DOpenMP_CXX_LIB_NAMES=libomp -DOpenMP_C_FLAG="-Xclang -fopenmp" -DOpenMP_C_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/include -DOpenMP_C_LIB_NAMES=libomp -DOpenMP_libomp_LIBRARY=/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib/libomp.dylib ..`

* Eigen error? Remember to specify vectors with 3 elements for 3D problems and 2 elements for 2D problems. The dimension of the problem is chosen as a global variable in `tools.hpp`.
